# Everywhere-Anytime-Ready-for-Loading-BOT
- E.A.R.L. Bot will be a personal autonomous assistant ready to help you carry your items. E.A.R.L. Bot will be able to follow you around using tracking modules and sensors, helping students carry things around campus!

##Team Members & Roles
- Michelle Lee
- Daniel Jaffe
- Hien Tran
- Chris Nucci

##Technologies
- Microcontroller: An Arduino board will serve as the main processing unit, handling sensor data,
motor control, and communication with the tracking system.
- User Tracking: The robot will use RFID, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons, or UltraWideband (UWB) technology to detect and follow a card or tag carried by the user. These technologies
allow accurate real-time positioning of the user even in busy environments.
- Receiver Modules: A corresponding RFID reader, BLE receiver, or UWB receiver on the robot
will process the signals from the user’s tag to determine distance and direction.
- Obstacle Detection and Avoidance: Ultrasonic sensors will scan the robot’s surroundings to detect
obstacles and navigate around them safely. Optional infrared (IR) sensors or LIDAR could be added
for higher accuracy in complex environments.
- Motion Control: Motor drivers will control the wheels, enabling smooth acceleration, deceleration,
and turning. Wheel encoders may be used for precise speed and distance measurement.
- Power Supply and Battery Management: A rechargeable battery will power the robot, and a
battery management system will ensure safe and efficient energy usage.
